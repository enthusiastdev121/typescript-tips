ðŸ”¥ Four ways to define an object type in TypeScript [pic.twitter.com/km4PQ4nMWl](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1524040757518258176/photo/1)

![// 1. We can manually define the keys with an interface or type interface Sizes {   small: number;   medium: number;   large: number; }  // 2. We can use the keys to define the types from a union type SizeList = 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';  interface Sizes2 {   [key in SizeList]: number; }  // 3. A record does exactly as above, but puts it into a utility function type Sizes3 = Record<SizeList, number>;  // 4. We can even make our own with Generics! let's step through what all this means type MakeRecord<Keys extends string | number | symbol, ValType> = {   [Prop in Keys]: ValType; }   // 1. The key of an object can be a string, number, or symbol   // 2. The value of an object can be any type, we pass it in as a generic ValType   // 3. Loop over each key and set as a property on the type   // 4. ValType will be whatever we pass in - in our case `number`   type sizes4 = MakeRecord<SizeList, number>;](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FSZ62g9XsAYbOSH.jpg)
