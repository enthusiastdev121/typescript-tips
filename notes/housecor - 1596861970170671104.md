TypeScript tip: Many optional properties are a code smell.

Why? Because it reduces type safety.

Example, I joined a project where every REST API call accepts this same argument. This creates confusion, and hurts type safety.

Solution? Specify exactly what each call needs. [pic.twitter.com/NEjVi4b2HF](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1596861970170671104/photo/1)
